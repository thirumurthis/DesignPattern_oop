Design principle :

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.

2. Program to an interface not an implementation.

3. Favour composition over inheritance.

	Composition is more of HAS-A relationship reference. Ex. Duck has-a relationship with the QuackBehaviour and FlyBehaviour.

4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
