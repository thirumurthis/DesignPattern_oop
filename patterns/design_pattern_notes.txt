Startegy Pattern:
   This pattern deines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable.
   Startegy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients use it.

Representation:
	The arrow with triangle head continous line represents inhertance ('extends').
	The arrow with triangle head dotted/breaked line represents interface ('implenetation').
	The arrow with normal convenstion continous line represents HAS-A relationship.
