STARTEGY PATTERN:
   This pattern deines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable.
   Startegy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients use it.

Representation:
	The arrow with triangle head continous line represents inhertance ('extends').
	The arrow with triangle head dotted/breaked line represents interface ('implenetation').
	The arrow with normal convenstion continous line represents HAS-A relationship.



OO Basics:
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
	Polymorphism
	Inheritance

OO Principles:
	Encapsulate what varies
	Favour composition over inheritance
	Program to interface, not implementations

OO Pattern:
	Strategy - defines a family of algorithm encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

	
OBSERVER PATTERN:
   This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

   This is more of a publisher - subscriber model, where in publisher is refered as SUBJECT and teh subscriber referred as OBSERVER. 
   
   Example is newspaper being published by the business company and readers subscribe and unsubscribe to recive the new newspaper.

   When the state of one object is change, all its dependents are notified.
